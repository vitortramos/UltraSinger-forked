## Why run UltraSinger as a container?

Running UltraSinger in a container bears the following advantages

- Environment Consistency: Containers ensure that the application runs in the same environment across different machines, reducing the "it works on my machine" problem.
- Isolation: Containers isolate the application from the host system, preventing conflicts with other applications and dependencies.
- Simplified Deployment: Containers package the application and its dependencies together, simplifying the deployment process.
- Security: Containers provide an additional layer of security by isolating applications from the host system and each other.
